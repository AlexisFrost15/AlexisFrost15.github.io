            I am a creative originally from Seattle, Wa. but currently living in
            Las Vegas, NV. I have been interested in art my whole life but I 
            have just recently started getting more into doing oil paintings as 
            well as writing and creating music. I started attending F.I.R.S.T to 
            get more basic knowledge that I felt I needed in art. 
            </p>
            <p class="second-p">
            Along my journey at first I was able to experince more into the 
            graphic design area as well as getting into some photography which I 
            have started to take up as a side project. In my freetime I am 
            either creating art, making muusic or playing video games. I also 
            enjoy doing a good bit of reading from time to time. Below are a few
            of some of my work.
