                    An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree 
                    (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and 
                    are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The 
                    tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, 
                    Malus sieversii, is still found. Apples have been grown for 
                    thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were introduced to
                    North America by European colonists. Apples have religious 
                    and mythological significance in many cultures, including 
                    Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those 
                    of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks 
                    desired characteristics. For commercial purposes, including 
                    botanical evaluation, apple cultivars are propagated by 
                    clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without 
                    rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after 
                    planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth
                    and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier 
                    harvesting.

                    The word apple, whose Old English ancestor is æppel, is 
                    descended from the Proto-Germanic noun *aplaz, descended in 
                    turn from Proto-Indo-European *h₂ébōl.[4]
                    As late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a 
                    generic term for all fruit including nuts—such as the 
                    14th-century Middle English expression appel of paradis, 
                    meaning a banana.[5]

                    The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 2 to 4.5 m
                    (6 to 15 ft) tall in cultivation and up to 9 m (30 ft) in 
                    the wild. When cultivated, the size, shape and branch 
                    density are determined by rootstock selection and trimming 
                    method. The leaves are alternately arranged dark 
                    green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and 
                    slightly downy undersides.[6]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the 
                    budding of the leaves and are produced on spurs and some 
                    long shoots. The 3 to 4 cm (1 to 1+1⁄2 in) flowers are white
                    with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five petaled, with 
                    an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4–6 flowers. The
                    central flower of the inflorescence is called the "king 
                    bloom"; it opens first and can develop a larger fruit.[6][
                </p>
                <h4><b>Skin</b></h4>
                <p>
                    The groundcolor of ripe apples is yellow, green, 
                    yellow-green or whitish yellow. The overcolor of ripe apples
                    can be orange-red, pink-red, red, purple-red or brown-red. 
                    The skin can also be russetted. The overcolor amount can be
                    0-100%. [8] The skin may also be wholly or partly russeted
                    i.e. rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective
                    layer of epicuticular wax.[9] The exocarp (flesh) is 
                    generally pale yellowish-white,[8] though pink, yellow 
                    or green exocarps also occur. 
                </p>
                <h4><b>Wild Ancestors</b></h4>
                <p>
                    The original wild ancestor of Malus domestica was Malus 
                    sieversii, found growing wild in the mountains of Central 
                    Asia in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and 
                    northwestern China.[6][10] Cultivation of the species, most 
                    likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan 
                    mountains, progressed over a long period of time and 
                    permitted secondary introgression of genes from other 
                    species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange
                    with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in 
                    populations of apples being more related to crabapples than
                    to the more morphologically similar progenitor Malus 
                    sieversii. In strains without recent admixture the 
                    contribution of the latter predominates.[11][12][13]

                        Malus sieversii is recognized as a major progenitor 
                        species to the cultivated apple, and is morphologically
                        similar. Due to the genetic variability in Central Asia,
                        this region is 
                        generally considered the center of origin for apples.[21] 
                        The apple is thought to have been domesticated 4000–10000 
                        years ago in the Tian Shan mountains, and then to have 
                        travelled along the Silk Road to Europe, with hybridization
                        and introgression of wild crabapples from Siberia 
                        (M. baccata), the Caucasus (M. orientalis), and Europe 
                        (M. sylvestris). Only the M. sieversii trees growing on 
                        the western side of the Tian Shan mountains contributed 
                        'genetically to the domesticated apple, not the isolated 
                        population on the eastern side.[20]

                        more than 2000 years in China. These are thought to be 
                        hybrids between M. baccata and M. sieversii in

                        Northeastern Italy, seeds from some form of apples have 
                        been found in material carbon dated to around 4000 BCE.
                        [22] Genetic analysis has not yet been successfully used

                <h4><b>Greek Mythology</b></h4>
                <p>
                    Apples appear in many religious traditions, often as a 
                    mystical or forbidden fruit. One of the problems identifying
                     apples in religion, mythology and folktales is that the 
                     word "apple" was used as a generic term for all (foreign) 
                     fruit, other than berries, including nuts, as late as the 
                     17th century.[34] For instance, in Greek mythology, the 
                     Greek hero Heracles, as a part of his Twelve Labours, was 
                     required to travel to the Garden of the Hesperides and pick
                      the golden apples off the Tree of Life growing at its 
                      center.[35][36][37]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Greek goddess of discord, Eris, became disgruntled after
                    she was excluded from the wedding of Peleus and Thetis.[38]
                    In retaliation, she tossed a golden apple inscribed 
                    Καλλίστη (Kalliste, sometimes transliterated Kallisti, 
                    "For the most beautiful one"), into the wedding party. 
                    Three goddesses claimed the apple: Hera, Athena, and 
                    Aphrodite. Paris of Troy was appointed to select the 
                    recipient. After being bribed by both Hera and Athena, 
                    Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in 
                    the world, Helen of Sparta. He awarded the apple to 
                    Aphrodite, thus indirectly causing the Trojan War.[39]
                    The apple was thus considered, in ancient Greece, sacred to 
                    Aphrodite. To throw an apple at someone was to symbolically 
                    declare one's love; and similarly, to catch it was to 
                    symbolically show one's acceptance of that love. An epigram 
                    claiming authorship by Plato states:[40]
                </p>
                <h4><b>Christian Art</b></h4>
                <p>
                    Though the forbidden fruit of Eden in the Book of Genesis is
                    not identified, popular Christian tradition has held that 
                    it was an apple that Eve coaxed Adam to share with her.[41]
                    The origin of the popular identification with a fruit 
                    unknown in the Middle East in biblical times is found in 
                    wordplay with the Latin words mālum (an apple) and mălum 
                    (an evil), each of which is normally written malum.[42] 
                    The tree of the forbidden fruit is called "the tree of the
                    knowledge of good and evil" in Genesis 2:17,[43] and the 
                    Latin for "good and evil" is bonum et malum.[44]

                <h4><b>Breeding</b></h4>
                <p>
                    Many apples grow readily from seeds. However, more than with
                    most perennial fruits, apples must be propagated asexually 
                    to obtain the sweetness and other desirable characteristics
                    of the parent. This is because seedling apples are an 
                    example of "extreme heterozygotes", in that rather than 
                    inheriting genes from their parents to create a new apple
                    with parental characteristics, they are instead 
                    significantly different from their parents, perhaps to 
                    compete with the many pests.[54] Triploid cultivars have an 
                    additional reproductive barrier in that three sets of 
                    chromosomes cannot be divided evenly during meiosis, 
                    yielding unequal segregation of the chromosomes 
                    (aneuploids). Even in the case when a triploid plant can 
                    produce a seed (apples are an example), it occurs 
                    infrequently, and seedlings rarely survive.[55]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because apples are not true breeders when planted as seeds, 
                    although cuttings can take root and breed true, and may live
                     for a century, grafting is usually used. The rootstock used
                      for the bottom of the graft can be selected to produce 
                      trees of a large variety of sizes, as well as changing the
                       winter hardiness, insect and disease resistance, and soil
                        preference of the resulting tree. Dwarf rootstocks can 
                        be used to produce very small trees (less than 3.0 m or 
                        10 ft high at maturity), which bear fruit many years 
                        earlier in their life cycle than full size trees, and 
                        are easier to harvest.[56]
